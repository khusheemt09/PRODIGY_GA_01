STEPS INVOLVED : 

1. Set Up Your Environment
Install required Python libraries like transformers, datasets, torch.

Make sure your Python environment (Colab, VS Code, etc.) is properly configured.

2. Prepare a Custom Dataset
Create a dataset with sentences or paragraphs related to AI, robots, machine learning, or Gen AI.

Format the data into a simple list or table where each row is a training sentence.

3. Load Pre-trained GPT-2
Use the Hugging Face library to load the GPT-2 model and tokenizer.

The model is pre-trained on general text, and you'll fine-tune it for your custom domain.

4. Tokenize Your Dataset
Convert the text into numerical format (input IDs and attention masks) using the tokenizer.

Ensure the data is padded or truncated to a fixed length for model compatibility.

5. Fine-Tune the Model
Define training parameters like batch size, number of epochs, and logging steps.

Use a Trainer to train the model on your dataset so it learns your datasetâ€™s style and context.

6. Generate Text with the Trained Model
Accept a custom prompt as input.

Generate extended, coherent text based on that prompt using the fine-tuned model.

7. Evaluate the Output
Read the generated text and observe whether it follows the style and theme of your dataset.

Experiment with different prompts and generation settings to improve results.

8. Optional: Save and Share
Save your fine-tuned model.

Upload your project to GitHub with a clear description and README.
