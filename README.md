**Text Generation with Fine-Tuned GPT-2 🤖🧠**
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune GPT-2, a transformer-based language model developed by OpenAI, to generate coherent and contextually relevant text using a custom dataset.

The dataset is carefully curated with technical and creative lines centered on concepts in artificial intelligence. The model learns the tone, structure, and semantics of the dataset and then generates extended, relevant content from any custom input prompt provided by the user.
